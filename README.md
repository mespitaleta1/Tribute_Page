### Tribute Page

this project was created to give tribute for the Nobel prize in literature, Gabriel Garcia Marquez. A huge writer who could wrap all countries in the same feelings and one of the greatest representatives of the "marvelous realism" or "magic realism" that is a style of fiction that paints a realistic view (faithfully represent reality and create some emotional tension without carrying out any idealization).

In a technical level, this project was created with:

- HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), with a BEM methodology
- A simple design with an orange and yellow color palette to represent the
  iconic yellow butterfly from the famous book "Cien a침os de Soledad", with
  which he won the Nobel Prize in 1982.

> "Las cosas tienen vida propia, todo es cuesti칩n de despertarle el 치nima".

Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Cien a침os de Soledad.
